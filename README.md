### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Newly passionate about Data Science, which has led me to embark on a constant journey of discovery. I seek to apply my skills in areas such as machine learning, data analysis, and visualization to contribute to the community and grow professionally.

Experienced in Business Development and Strategy, Customer Service, and Marketing with international exposure in Latin America, Europe, and the USA. Passionate about discovering new cultures, art, and photography, as well as audiovisual production.

I am an Engineer in Administrative Sciences with a specialization in Business Management and a Master's Degree in Business Development with a focus on Digital Transformation. My skills include negotiation, project management, strategy, and business planning, as well as a solid knowledge of digital marketing, audiovisual production, and advertising.

Originally from Lima, Peru, I have lived in Ecuador, Spain, and Germany, and currently reside in New York, USA. I have also lived in Costa Rica, Canada, and the United States, allowing me to gain intercultural experience and highlighting this as one of my greatest strengths.

I am a Peruvian-German citizen with high proficiency in the English language, B2 level of German, a good understanding of Portuguese, and Spanish as my mother tongue.

 If you are interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to get in touch with me!
